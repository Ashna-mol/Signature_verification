# Signature Verification Using Siamese Neural Network

This project is a **Streamlit** web application that verifies signatures using a **Siamese Neural Network**. The application takes two signature images as input and predicts whether they match or not.

## Features
- Upload two signature images for comparison.
- Uses a **pre-trained Siamese Neural Network** to determine signature similarity.
- Displays **similarity score** and verification result (`Match` or `No Match`).
- Shows uploaded images side-by-side for visual comparison.
- Displays results in a **pandas DataFrame**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep Learning Model)
- **OpenCV** (Image Preprocessing)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (Data Processing)
- **Streamlit** (Web App Interface)
